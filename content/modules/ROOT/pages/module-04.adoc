== Running the upgrade

Now that you have verified the RHEL system meets all the expected
conditions, it is time to kick off the upgrade process:

NOTE: This process will take multiple minutes.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
leapp upgrade --target 8.8
----

.Output
[source,text]

====> * scan_files_for_target_userspace
        Scan the source system and identify files that will be copied into the target userspace when it is created.
====> * scanmemory
        Scan Memory of the machine.

<<< OUTPUT ABBRIDGED >>>

Complete!
====> * add_upgrade_boot_entry
        Add new boot entry for Leapp provided initramfs.
A reboot is required to continue. Please reboot your system.

Reboot the system to continue with the upgrade. This might take a while depending on the system configuration.
Make sure you have console access to view the actual upgrade process.
----

IMPORTANT: The upgrade has only been staged; it has not been completed at this point.

A reboot is required during which leapp performs several actions inside a temporary environment.

These include:

* Creating a new initramfs image
* Relabeling SELinux contexts
* Cleaning up any remaining RHEL 7 packages
* A final reboot to launch into RHEL 8

If your hypervisor and systems are configured for console access, it is possible to watch this process during the reboot. This option is unavailable in this lab. You will verify the upgrade by viewing the log files after completion.

TIP: You can combine the upgrade and reboot by adding the *-–reboot* option `*leapp upgrade --target 8.8 --reboot*`

Reboot the system now to initiate the final steps.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
reboot
----

IMPORTANT: This reboot can take up to 25 minutes. The terminal will lose connection with the leapp host leaving a `reconnect` button on the terminal.

After 15 - 20 minutes have passed, attempt to reconnect the session in by clicking the `reconnect` button periodically until you are reconnected.

== Verifying the upgrade

Once the new initramfs image is in place, package updates run, and
SELinux relabel completion, the system will perform one final reboot.
Once that is done, you will be logged into the system’s terminal once
more. Finally, we will verify the update was successful by looking at
the release file we referenced earlier in the lab:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

Note that we are now running the latest version of RHEL 8!

.Output
[source,text]
----
# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.8 (Ootpa)
----

NOTE: You may also review the log file if you so choose. The full
output is available at /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
less /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log
----

There are other methods for upgrading to the latest version of RHEL
using the leapp tooling including the Web Console and Satellite. For
those operations, refer to the documentation on Red Hat’s website.

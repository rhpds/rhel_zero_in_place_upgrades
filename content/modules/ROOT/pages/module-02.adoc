== Running the pre-upgrade assistant and resolving issues

Built into the leapp tool is a utility that collects data about the
system, assesses upgradability, and generates a pre-upgrade report. On
your lab system, perform the pre-upgrade test.

NOTE: This process will take a couple minutes.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
leapp preupgrade --target 8.8

Notice how the upgrade was "*`inhibited`*" because the preupgrade
assistant requires your input on one or more issues before it will
safely proceed. The preupgrade tool has generated an answerfile in
"*`/var/log/leapp`*".

Inside of this file, it has generated a true/false
question regarding PAM PKCS11 modules:
